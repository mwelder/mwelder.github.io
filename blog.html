        <h4 class="w3-text-white">Playing Bloons Tower Defense 6</h4>
        <p class="small-p-text">To start this sprint and to prepare for my first deliverables, I
          finally sat down to play Bloons Tower Defense 6 for the first time.
          Not only was it important that I become more familiar with the game
          that Project Tower is based on, but I specifically wanted to take a
          look at the approach to audio in BTD6. I accessed what I think does
          and doesn't work in the game's audio as well as which aspects I'd want
          to adapt to Project Tower.<br><br>

          I noted that the music overall is very cheery and energetic. The main
          menu music is pleasant and upbeat which fits with the bright,
          colorful visuals and laid-back feel. Once I entered the first level,
          the music had a very similar energy to it.<br><br>

          While the music is pleasant, inoffensive, and appropriate with the
          game's theme, I felt that it was a bit stagnant and maybe too
          consistent in all aspects. The meter, mode, instruments, and overall
          musical style were all largely unchanging between tracks. It was all
          a bit too samey for my liking, especially for a soundtrack that
          demands some level of attention from the player with how high-energy
          it is.<br><br>

          This music struck me as the kind that a player would have no problem
          turning off if they were to play for long periods of time since it's
          so repetitive and unchanging. To avoid making easily mutable or
          uninteresting music for Project Tower, I want to focus on making
          appropriately long music loops, varied music tracks, and a polished
          sound overall. I also would love for the chance to implement an
          adaptive soundtrack that would rise and fall in tension in accordance
          to player progress or level difficulty, but I understand that this
          may be a stretch goal and I'll have to further discuss it with the
          rest of the audio team.<br><br>

          The sound effects for placing units and popping balloons were
          appropriately simple and did their job well and I hope to replicate
          their style for Project Tower. However, the fact that the balloon
          popping SFX is so constant, I want to be sure that whichever sound
          Project Tower uses for defeating enemies never gets tiring to hear by
          means of adding variation.<br><br>

          There are voice-over sound effects for the powerful Hero monkey units
          in BTD6. While this has inspired me to consider voice-overs for
          narrative cutscenes or as feedback sounds during gameplay, I really
          disliked the voice-over used in BTD6. It's a little difficult for me
          to point my finger on why, but something about the voices and lines
          given to these monkey characters struck me as campy and inconsistent
          with the rest of the game’s theme. I'll be able to have a better idea
          of what not to do if voice-overs are ever added to Project Tower.
        </p>
        <h4 class="w3-text-white">Meeting with the Audio Team</h4>
        <p class="small-p-text">I've begun having weekly Tuesday meetings on
          Discord with the two others working on audio, Emily and Crystal. In
          these meetings, we discuss the creative direction and ideas we have
          for the game’s audio, divide the audio-related issues of the given
          sprint amongst each other, set short-term deliverable and learning
          goals for ourselves, plan for upcoming tasks, provide feedback on
          each other’s work, and more. It’s been a really helpful opportunity
          to share and develop new ideas, have a smaller team with which I can
          discuss audio-related issues and goals, learn from the skills of
          others, and feel organized and motivated as an audio team.
        </p>

          <img src="MusicIdeasConfluence.png" alt="Music Idea Notes on Confluence" style="width:100%;">
          <figcaption style="text-align:center; color: white">Music Idea Notes on Confluence</figcaption>
        </figure>
        <p class="small-p-text">As I was tasked with creating the first draft of the game’s main
          menu music and Emily was responsible for the first level music, we
          met an additional time between our two Tuesday audio team meetings
          for this Pre-Alpha I sprint. We wanted to collaborate on identifying
          the beginnings of Project Tower’s musical identity. Since the game’s
          theme that of Old Norse mythology, we researched and discussed which
          instruments, musical modes, and styles to use in order to reinforce
          the game’s theming. As the tone of the project was recently refined
          by the team working on the game’s narrative, we were also able to
          discuss how to refine our own musical devices and tone. We created a
          page in Confluence to record our ideas to refer to later on. This
          also serves as a living document as we find more resources and come
          up with more focused ideas.
          <br><br>
          Additionally, we started a Youtube
          playlist full of relevant reference music, video game soundtracks,
          traditional Scandinavian music, and otherwise, to find inspiration
          for our own music.
        </p>
        <h4 class="w3-text-white">Composing the Main Menu Theme</h4>
        <p class="small-p-text">Composing the first draft for the main menu
          music began with several challenges and inconveniences, but turned
          out well in the end! The process began with me experimenting with
          various audio tools and plug-ins to see what kind of interesting
          sounds I’d be able to use for the project. I wasn’t yet familiar
          with these newer tools, so I then switched to using tools I was more
          familiar with and ended up with a product that I was satisfied with.
          <br><br>
          I referred to the rough notes on the musical devices to use and tone
          to go for, listened to Emily’s draft of the game’s first level
          theme, and listened to various reference music (mostly examples of
          Scandanavian folk and medieval music). These greatly helped inform
          the direction of my own work and made sure that my menu theme would
          coincide thematically with the level music as well as with the rest
          of the game.

          <figcaption style="text-align:center; color: white">The main menu music project in FL Studio.</figcaption>
        </figure>
        <p class="small-p-text">With the notes and music references, I sought out instruments that
          resemble those used in old Scandinavia while using low strings as a
          drone that ground the piece. I found the instruments I wanted but
          wanted to make these synthesized instruments sound more convincing
          and expressive. However, the particular device I needed for this
          wasn’t working as expected, so I ended up spending a long time
          troubleshooting without being able to resolve all of the issues. I
          ultimately had to abandon the device for now and do the best I could
          with more traditional and limiting methods for the time being.

        </figure>
        <p class="small-p-text">In the end, I think the main menu music draft I’ve produced sounds
          like a solid start with a melancholic tone, traditional-sounding
          instruments, and sound samples of the sea all to reinforce the
          game’s tone and help create a musical identity within the game’s
          soundtrack.

        <p class="small-p-text">Overall, it was challenging for me to complete
          all of the tasks I originally set out to do due to some unexpected
          obstacles in my progress and several time-consuming priorities in my
          life that unfortunately coincided with this sprint. Despite the
          challenges, I was able to create some sound effects and ambiances for
          the game, I made some strides in learning audio implementation, and
          the audio team as a whole made good progress in terms of plans for our
          next tasks. With a new sprint starting and a more typical schedule,
          I’ll be working hard to plan ahead and complete all my tasks to make
          up for the ones I missed this sprint.
        </p>
        <h4 class="w3-text-white">Audio Team Meetings</h4>
        <p class="small-p-text">During this sprint, the audio team had two of our weekly meetings and
          I had one more with Crystal to discuss audio implementation. Beyond
          the typical discussion of choosing tasks and talking about our
          progress, something we focused on was creating a more unified sound
          for the game by finding free audio plug-in software instruments that
          all of us could use across our different DAWs. We took into
          consideration the sounds and instruments used in our music drafts
          until this point as we decided on new accessible, cross-platform
          instruments to use. We narrowed down all of the main instruments we
          would need to 1-3 software instruments each and this will be refined
          as we continue to experiment with these.<br><br>

          I’ve been trying to learn more about the audio implementation side
          of things, so I had an additional meeting with Crystal who taught me
          the basics of making and managing new branches of the project,
          using Wwise, and integrating the Wwise project into the game’s
          Unity project. I learned a lot and was able to implement a
          temporary sound effect into the game during this meeting, so I’ll
          continue practicing by completing Wwise tutorials and I’ll soon be
          helping Crystal with implementing the sounds and music we create.
        </p>

        <h4 class="w3-text-white">Recording Ambiances and Creating SFX</h4>
        <p class="small-p-text">I was tasked with creating some ambiance audio
          for the game, so I planned to go out to capture some field recordings
          to have more of my own material to work with. It's not fully decided
          how the ambiance tracks may be used in the game, but the audio
          team has considered using ambiances in place of music at key moments
          in the narrative scenes where it may be appropriate, for as a
          low-volume background noise along with music during the levels as they
          change in scenery. One of the sounds I was most looking forward to
          recording was that of insects and other animals at night. However, the
          day I had the chance to go out at night to record, the temperature had
          just dropped dramatically and all of the vibrant insect sounds I heard
          the day prior had all fallen silent as they died or went dormant for
          the winter. I also wanted to record the sound of wind rustling the
          leaves of trees and bushes as the winds in the area picked up and I
          considered how that could be a cool sound to have in order to recreate
          a virtual environment in-game. Once I listened back to these
          recordings, I realized that they were unfortunately unusable. The
          small portable recorder I have doesn’t have a windshield, so all of
          the recorded wind noises are really distorted.<br><br>

          Because of these obstacles, I ended up using mostly old nature
          recordings of mine which were a little limited but they worked well
          for what I had. So far, the only ambience track ready for
          implementation is that for crickets.

        <p class="small-p-text">I’ll record more soon, rely on editing preexisting free-to-use
          sounds from online, and consider synthesizing my own ambient tracks
          for the future.<br><br>

          I also worked on creating some sound effects by using an online
          free-to-use sound as a starting point and heavily editing them. I’m
          familiar with sound design for music, so transferring the skills and
          knowledge of audio effects to transform sounds into the sound effects
          that the game needs has been a fun challenge. Here’s the first draft
          for the sound effect of a bulk enemy ship breaking down.
