                With temp sounds in the game and several references gathered by
                the audio team in pre-production, during this sprint I focused
                on beginning some of the important documentation the audio team
                will refer to and update throughout the project as well as
                having the audio team generate brief snippets of concept music.
              </p>
              <h4 class="w3-text-white">Concept Music Snippets</h4>
              <p class="small-p-text">
                For this sprint I gave each of the four audio team members
                (including myself) the task to create 2 approximately 30-second
                music tracks based on the game’s themes and the game and movie
                references we had gathered the week prior.
                <br><br>
                While working on these two music concepts, I took my time to
                explore some synth instruments I haven't used before and
                challenged myself by making my own custom synths with minimal
                use of preset settings. I used this low-stakes opportunity to
                try some new things: making a sequencer in the Serum plug-in,
                using sampled video game music as a sampler instrument, and
                trying some musical styles I'm not used to. I prioritized
                creating contrasting compositional ideas down, so I didn't worry
                about mixing very much. I kept the cyberpunk theme in mind while
                making these without worrying too much about the fine details of
                our game in this early stage it's in.

                It was a really fun and engaging time listening to everyone
                else’s music concepts and discussing them together. Everyone was
                really creative and displayed great skill in creating varying
                styles of music that all worked well within the overall theme
                and style of cyberpunk.
              </p>
              <h4 class="w3-text-white">Documentation and Research</h4>
              <p class="small-p-text">
                The audio asset list and style document were two important
                pieces of documentation that I created this sprint. They both
                began with research which included watching and taking notes on
                a GDC presentation on how to design for sound in a game, reading
                articles on how to create a design document, watching tutorials
                on sound design techniques, and watching gameplay of several
                games as references. I also originally planned to complete some
                official Wwise tutorials to solidify and expand upon my
                understanding of audio implementation, but this has to be
                delayed until the next sprint due to a lack of time.
              </p>
              <p class="small-p-text">
                The audio asset list contains all sounds that I can imagine
                being in the game given the current design details and
                understanding of the game in this early stage. It will be a
                living document as more details are clarified and as I continue
                to make decisions on what sounds are needed.
              </p>

              <p class="small-p-text">
                Similarly, the audio style document will continue to be updated
                as I come to learn new details and make more decisions as the
                project goes on. As of now, it’s a good start with both broad
                and specific ideas for the game’s music and sound effects.
                However, I haven’t finalized the video references to other games
                that I would like to include in the document as benchmarks or
                comparisons to what I’m envisioning, so adding these will be my
                next step.

              <h4 class="w3-text-white">Playing Bloons Tower Defense 6</h4>
              <p class="small-p-text">To start this sprint and to prepare for my first deliverables, I
                finally sat down to play Bloons Tower Defense 6 for the first time.
                Not only was it important that I become more familiar with the game
                that Project Tower is based on, but I specifically wanted to take a
                look at the approach to audio in BTD6. I accessed what I think does
                and doesn't work in the game's audio as well as which aspects I'd want
                to adapt to Project Tower.<br><br>

                I noted that the music overall is very cheery and energetic. The main
                menu music is pleasant and upbeat which fits with the bright,
                colorful visuals and laid-back feel. Once I entered the first level,
                the music had a very similar energy to it.<br><br>

                While the music is pleasant, inoffensive, and appropriate with the
                game's theme, I felt that it was a bit stagnant and maybe too
                consistent in all aspects. The meter, mode, instruments, and overall
                musical style were all largely unchanging between tracks. It was all
                a bit too samey for my liking, especially for a soundtrack that
                demands some level of attention from the player with how high-energy
                it is.<br><br>

                This music struck me as the kind that a player would have no problem
                turning off if they were to play for long periods of time since it's
                so repetitive and unchanging. To avoid making easily mutable or
                uninteresting music for Project Tower, I want to focus on making
                appropriately long music loops, varied music tracks, and a polished
                sound overall. I also would love for the chance to implement an
                adaptive soundtrack that would rise and fall in tension in accordance
                to player progress or level difficulty, but I understand that this
                may be a stretch goal and I'll have to further discuss it with the
                rest of the audio team.<br><br>

                The sound effects for placing units and popping balloons were
                appropriately simple and did their job well and I hope to replicate
                their style for Project Tower. However, the fact that the balloon
                popping SFX is so constant, I want to be sure that whichever sound
                Project Tower uses for defeating enemies never gets tiring to hear by
                means of adding variation.<br><br>

                There are voice-over sound effects for the powerful Hero monkey units
                in BTD6. While this has inspired me to consider voice-overs for
                narrative cutscenes or as feedback sounds during gameplay, I really
                disliked the voice-over used in BTD6. It's a little difficult for me
                to point my finger on why, but something about the voices and lines
                given to these monkey characters struck me as campy and inconsistent
                with the rest of the game’s theme. I'll be able to have a better idea
                of what not to do if voice-overs are ever added to Project Tower.
              </p>
              <h4 class="w3-text-white">Meeting with the Audio Team</h4>
              <p class="small-p-text">I've begun having weekly Tuesday meetings on
                Discord with the two others working on audio, Emily and Crystal. In
                these meetings, we discuss the creative direction and ideas we have
                for the game’s audio, divide the audio-related issues of the given
                sprint amongst each other, set short-term deliverable and learning
                goals for ourselves, plan for upcoming tasks, provide feedback on
                each other’s work, and more. It’s been a really helpful opportunity
                to share and develop new ideas, have a smaller team with which I can
                discuss audio-related issues and goals, learn from the skills of
                others, and feel organized and motivated as an audio team.

                <figcaption style="text-align:center; color: white">Music Idea Notes on Confluence</figcaption>
              </figure>
              <p class="small-p-text">As I was tasked with creating the first draft of the game’s main
                menu music and Emily was responsible for the first level music, we
                met an additional time between our two Tuesday audio team meetings
                for this Pre-Alpha I sprint. We wanted to collaborate on identifying
                the beginnings of Project Tower’s musical identity. Since the game’s
                theme that of Old Norse mythology, we researched and discussed which
                instruments, musical modes, and styles to use in order to reinforce
                the game’s theming. As the tone of the project was recently refined
                by the team working on the game’s narrative, we were also able to
                discuss how to refine our own musical devices and tone. We created a
                page in Confluence to record our ideas to refer to later on. This
                also serves as a living document as we find more resources and come
                up with more focused ideas.
                <br><br>
                Additionally, we started a Youtube
                playlist full of relevant reference music, video game soundtracks,
                traditional Scandinavian music, and otherwise, to find inspiration
                for our own music.
              </p>
              <h4 class="w3-text-white">Composing the Main Menu Theme</h4>
              <p class="small-p-text">Composing the first draft for the main menu
                music began with several challenges and inconveniences, but turned
                out well in the end! The process began with me experimenting with
                various audio tools and plug-ins to see what kind of interesting
                sounds I’d be able to use for the project. I wasn’t yet familiar
                with these newer tools, so I then switched to using tools I was more
                familiar with and ended up with a product that I was satisfied with.
                <br><br>
                I referred to the rough notes on the musical devices to use and tone
                to go for, listened to Emily’s draft of the game’s first level
                theme, and listened to various reference music (mostly examples of
                Scandanavian folk and medieval music). These greatly helped inform
                the direction of my own work and made sure that my menu theme would
                coincide thematically with the level music as well as with the rest

                resemble those used in old Scandinavia while using low strings as a
                drone that ground the piece. I found the instruments I wanted but
                wanted to make these synthesized instruments sound more convincing
                and expressive. However, the particular device I needed for this
                wasn’t working as expected, so I ended up spending a long time
                troubleshooting without being able to resolve all of the issues. I
                ultimately had to abandon the device for now and do the best I could
                with more traditional and limiting methods for the time being.

              <p class="small-p-text">Overall, it was challenging for me to complete
                all of the tasks I originally set out to do due to some unexpected
                obstacles in my progress and several time-consuming priorities in my
                life that unfortunately coincided with this sprint. Despite the
                challenges, I was able to create some sound effects and ambiances for
                the game, I made some strides in learning audio implementation, and
                the audio team as a whole made good progress in terms of plans for our
                next tasks. With a new sprint starting and a more typical schedule,
                I’ll be working hard to plan ahead and complete all my tasks to make
                up for the ones I missed this sprint.
              </p>
              <h4 class="w3-text-white">Audio Team Meetings</h4>
              <p class="small-p-text">During this sprint, the audio team had two of our weekly meetings and
                I had one more with Crystal to discuss audio implementation. Beyond
                the typical discussion of choosing tasks and talking about our
                progress, something we focused on was creating a more unified sound
                for the game by finding free audio plug-in software instruments that
                all of us could use across our different DAWs. We took into
                consideration the sounds and instruments used in our music drafts
                until this point as we decided on new accessible, cross-platform
                instruments to use. We narrowed down all of the main instruments we
                would need to 1-3 software instruments each and this will be refined
                as we continue to experiment with these.<br><br>

                I’ve been trying to learn more about the audio implementation side
                of things, so I had an additional meeting with Crystal who taught me
                the basics of making and managing new branches of the project,
                using Wwise, and integrating the Wwise project into the game’s
                Unity project. I learned a lot and was able to implement a
                temporary sound effect into the game during this meeting, so I’ll
                continue practicing by completing Wwise tutorials and I’ll soon be
                helping Crystal with implementing the sounds and music we create.
              </p>

              <h4 class="w3-text-white">Recording Ambiances and Creating SFX</h4>
              <p class="small-p-text">I was tasked with creating some ambiance audio
                for the game, so I planned to go out to capture some field recordings
                to have more of my own material to work with. It's not fully decided
                how the ambiance tracks may be used in the game, but the audio
                team has considered using ambiances in place of music at key moments
                in the narrative scenes where it may be appropriate, for as a
                low-volume background noise along with music during the levels as they
                change in scenery. One of the sounds I was most looking forward to
                recording was that of insects and other animals at night. However, the
                day I had the chance to go out at night to record, the temperature had
                just dropped dramatically and all of the vibrant insect sounds I heard
                the day prior had all fallen silent as they died or went dormant for
                the winter. I also wanted to record the sound of wind rustling the
                leaves of trees and bushes as the winds in the area picked up and I
                considered how that could be a cool sound to have in order to recreate
                a virtual environment in-game. Once I listened back to these
                recordings, I realized that they were unfortunately unusable. The
                small portable recorder I have doesn’t have a windshield, so all of
                the recorded wind noises are really distorted.<br><br>

                Because of these obstacles, I ended up using mostly old nature
                recordings of mine which were a little limited but they worked well
                for what I had. So far, the only ambience track ready for
                implementation is that for crickets.

                I also worked on creating some sound effects by using an online
                free-to-use sound as a starting point and heavily editing them. I’m
                familiar with sound design for music, so transferring the skills and
                knowledge of audio effects to transform sounds into the sound effects
                that the game needs has been a fun challenge. Here’s the first draft

              <h4 class="w3-text-white">Audio Team Meetings</h4>
              <p class="small-p-text">
                In the audio team’s last meeting we updated our list of essential
                tasks for the rest of the pre-beta period. To finalize our list, we
                played some of the sandbox mode in BTD6 together on the Discord call
                which led to a lot of interesting conversations on which sounds we
                should include or omit from our own game.<br><br>
                During this conversation, I brought up some of the stretch goals we
                had mentioned at the beginning of this semester so that we could
                decide on which of these final goals we wanted to commit to. Since
                these stretch goals would be time-consuming tasks, planning for these
                would have to start early. The two main considerations were dynamic
                music and voice acting. Months ago, we briefly talked about the
                idea of having music that would dynamically change in accordance
                with the intensity of the game on-screen. It would be
                constructed by musical layers that would build up or thin out
                over time. However, this would’ve added a big task for the
                programming team to create triggers for these musical moments
                based on some kind of in-game statistic. Also, the audio team
                would’ve had to make a lot of changes to the music we already
                had in the game.<br><br>

                Therefore, we began discussing a plan to implement voice acting
                for the 2 main visual novel narrative scenes in the game. This
                wouldn’t add too much additional work for the programming team
                and it would do a lot to the game in making the narrative scenes
                more engaging and expressive. We have yet to figure out all of
                the specifics, but we’ll find 2 people, either from within the
                studio or externally, to act as the two voiced characters. I
                have access to and certification at the audio studios at the
                Duderstadt Center, so we’ll book one of those and should be able
                to record all of the lines in one session. I’ll be doing the
                recording and editing of the dialog lines, and I’m really
                excited about this new feature!
              </p>
              <h4 class="w3-text-white">Finding New Strategies for Creating SFX</h4>
              <p class="small-p-text">
                Most of my time working on tasks this sprint was recording and
                creating sound effects. While I have a bit of practice with
                sound design for music, designing sounds to sound the way I
                heard them in my head was more challenging than I originally
                expected. At first, I tried really hard to make new sounds from
                scratch by using simple oscillators and effects but I’m not
                experienced enough with digital sound synthesis to have figured
                it out in a reasonable time. After talking to the rest of the
                audio team about my challenges and listening to their processes,
                I decided to simplify my own process. I began using the
                preexisting free-to-use sounds that we had in our game as
                temporary assets, my library of free sound samples, and my own
                recordings as a basis. I then could more easily edit, process,
                and layer them to fit the sound I was going for. This way, I
                made variations of the enemy death sound by layering the
                preexisting sound in-game and layering my processed vocal
                recordings on top of that. Similarly, the UI sounds for when the
                mouse hovers over and then clicks a button where edited sounds
                of castanets, percussion instrument samples I had saved from
                years ago.

                Overall, despite being busy at the beginning of the sprint, I
                made good progress by the end of it that I am proud of. Even
                though composing music went a bit slower than it normally does,
                I still made some progress on that which I’ll be able to put
                into the game soon, and I made several sound effects using new
                strategies that made things easier and more creatively engaging
                for me to get done.

                The audio team had an especially productive and long meeting on
                November 16th where we listened to all of the audio we had in
                the game so far and finalized a list of those that needed to be
                iterated on and those that had yet to be created. At this point,
                only a few more sounds had to be added which was a great
                feeling! It was a nice experience to go through all of the
                sounds we had created in order to look at our progress and talk
                about how things could be further improved, mostly my means of
                mixing techniques. During the meeting, we were able to walk
                through editing several of these sound effects together by
                screen-sharing. We got to share different mixing strategies with
                one another which was insightful.
                <br><br>
                We also did some planning for the voice acting recording. Since
                we had to record within the following week which would’ve made
                casting difficult, it was fortunate that Emily and Crystal were
                willing and eager to be the voice actors. Crystal had her own
                mic, but Emily didn’t and I didn’t have anything to let her
                borrow. I had access to rent mics through the music school and
                the Performing Arts Technology department I’m a part of, but if
                I was going to go out of my way to reserve something, I wanted
                to make sure we got the best recordings possible. In a later
                meeting on November 24th, separate from our weekly Tuesday
                meeting on the 23rd, we listened through all of the dialogue.

              <p class="small-p-text">
                I reserved the Audio Studio C at the Duderstadt Center for 3
                hours for Emily and I to have plenty of time to practice and
                record her lines and for me to troubleshoot any potential
                challenges in the studio. We started by looking at the script
                that Crystal had sent to us, talking about how different lines
                might sound, and listening to some relevant examples of
                character voice acting in video games. It was still undecided
                which voices Crystal and Emily would do for the game, so Emily
                recorded voices for the two voiced characters since we had the
                time for it.

              <p class="small-p-text">
                We cleared out the nearby isolation booth for us to record her
                lines in a quieter and more acoustically treated space compared
                to the studio’s main control room. I was able to set up the
                studio so that her microphone was routed from the iso booth to
                the control room where I was, and she was able to hear her voice
                routed back into her headphones. I set up the headphone mix
                mostly in case I wanted to process her voice during recording
                and would want her to be able to hear how she sounded with the
                effect in realtime, but I ended up not using any effects during
                the recording session. However, sending her a headphone mix did
                help so that we could listen back to her previous takes together
                without her having to go back and forth between rooms after each
                take. I stayed in the control room to record all of her takes. I
                didn’t think there was any talkback system in Audio Studio C for
                me to somehow send my voice to Emily for when we needed to talk
                in between takes, so we simply called each other over the phone
                to communicate between takes while we were in different rooms.<br><br>

                The setup for recording took me a little longer than expected
                since I hadn’t worked in the Duderstadt studios for a while and
                Audio Studio C had a few notable changes since I had last been
                in there, but, in the end, things worked as we had hoped and the
                recordings came out amazing!<br><br>

                We recorded on a Shure KSM44A large diaphragm condenser
                microphone and an Aviom A-16II was used to send Emily the
                headphone mix.

              <h4 class="w3-text-white">Selecting and Editing Dialogue</h4>
              <p class="small-p-text">
                Once Emily and I had recorded her lines for the two potential
                characters she was voicing, Crystal recorded her own takes for
                these two characters plus lines for the narrator. After lines to
                all of their lines, we decided that we would use Emily’s voice
                for the two characters and Crystal’s for the narration. Emily
                had an impressive range in her character voices and Crystal’s
                delivery of the narration was perfect for telling the story.<br><br>

                With this I listened through all of the takes on my own and
                selected the best delivery for each line in the dialogue. After
                cutting and naming these selected takes, I applied a series of
                noise reduction, EQ-ing, loudness matching, compression, gating,
                and amplification to all of these audio files so that they sound
                clear and consistent, especially since Emily and Crystal’s lines
                were recorded in completely different locations and with
                different mics.

                During this sprint I also iterated on several sound effects and

              <p class="small-p-text">
                The audio meetings during these Gold sprints focused mostly on
                mixing and polishing what we already had in the game along with
                adding in the very last pieces. Our first meeting of the Gold I
                sprint was spent going through the game together and discussing
                which sounds should be rebalanced just in terms of volume and
                which ones should be edited and mixed. For example, I ended up
                re-exporting some music tracks so that they would loop better
                in-game. We were able to have a game audio professional, Jeffery
                “Pumodi” Brice, playtest the game for some more audio-specific
                feedback. I was unable to attend the meeting, but Crystal was
                able to and took great notes of Pumodi’s comments. From this
                playtest, we were able to make a list of all of the things we
                could improve on and prioritize them. One of the main criticisms
                was how the main enemy death sound effects would sound too much
                like indiscernible digital noise when repeated at a quick
                frequency when the game was played at 3 times speed.

              <h4 class="w3-text-white">Creating and Reiterating on SFX</h4>
              <p class="small-p-text">
                The addition of another special type of enemy, the ceramic type,
                called for additional enemy sound effects. I used several
                samples of glass and ceramic breaking sounds to make the damage
                and break sound effects for these enemies which, upon breaking,
                release additional enemies.

              <p class="small-p-text">
                I also had to reiterate the variations of the enemy death sound
                effects to make them a bit less consistent. These sounds are
                made up of a layer of a “whoosh” sound recorded from a stick
                swinging in the air and another layer of a processed vocal
                sample of mine, a unique one for each variation. The whoosh
                layer was the main issue since it was too consistent, so I tried
                to make it a bit softer and added additional effects to add
                additional variation. Crystal also incorporated some subtle
                pitch variation when she implemented these new sounds into the
                game.
