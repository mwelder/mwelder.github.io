          <h4 class="w3-text-white">Playing Bloons Tower Defense 6</h4>
          <p class="small-p-text">To start this sprint and to prepare for my first deliverables, I
            finally sat down to play Bloons Tower Defense 6 for the first time.
            Not only was it important that I become more familiar with the game
            that Project Tower is based on, but I specifically wanted to take a
            look at the approach to audio in BTD6. I accessed what I think does
            and doesn't work in the game's audio as well as which aspects I'd want
            to adapt to Project Tower.<br><br>

            I noted that the music overall is very cheery and energetic. The main
            menu music is pleasant and upbeat which fits with the bright,
            colorful visuals and laid-back feel. Once I entered the first level,
            the music had a very similar energy to it.<br><br>

            While the music is pleasant, inoffensive, and appropriate with the
            game's theme, I felt that it was a bit stagnant and maybe too
            consistent in all aspects. The meter, mode, instruments, and overall
            musical style were all largely unchanging between tracks. It was all
            a bit too samey for my liking, especially for a soundtrack that
            demands some level of attention from the player with how high-energy
            it is.<br><br>

            This music struck me as the kind that a player would have no problem
            turning off if they were to play for long periods of time since it's
            so repetitive and unchanging. To avoid making easily mutable or
            uninteresting music for Project Tower, I want to focus on making
            appropriately long music loops, varied music tracks, and a polished
            sound overall. I also would love for the chance to implement an
            adaptive soundtrack that would rise and fall in tension in accordance
            to player progress or level difficulty, but I understand that this
            may be a stretch goal and I'll have to further discuss it with the
            rest of the audio team.<br><br>

            The sound effects for placing units and popping balloons were
            appropriately simple and did their job well and I hope to replicate
            their style for Project Tower. However, the fact that the balloon
            popping SFX is so constant, I want to be sure that whichever sound
            Project Tower uses for defeating enemies never gets tiring to hear by
            means of adding variation.<br><br>

            There are voice-over sound effects for the powerful Hero monkey units
            in BTD6. While this has inspired me to consider voice-overs for
            narrative cutscenes or as feedback sounds during gameplay, I really
            disliked the voice-over used in BTD6. It's a little difficult for me
            to point my finger on why, but something about the voices and lines
            given to these monkey characters struck me as campy and inconsistent
            with the rest of the game’s theme. I'll be able to have a better idea
            of what not to do if voice-overs are ever added to Project Tower.

          <h4 class="w3-text-white">Meeting with the Audio Team</h4>
          <p class="small-p-text">I've begun having weekly Tuesday meetings on
            Discord with the two others working on audio, Emily and Crystal. In
            these meetings, we discuss the creative direction and ideas we have
            for the game’s audio, divide the audio-related issues of the given
            sprint amongst each other, set short-term deliverable and learning
            goals for ourselves, plan for upcoming tasks, provide feedback on
            each other’s work, and more. It’s been a really helpful opportunity
            to share and develop new ideas, have a smaller team with which I can
            discuss audio-related issues and goals, learn from the skills of
            others, and feel organized and motivated as an audio team.
          </p>

            <figcaption style="text-align:center; color: white">Music Idea Notes on Confluence</figcaption>
          </figure>
          <p class="small-p-text">As I was tasked with creating the first draft of the game’s main
            menu music and Emily was responsible for the first level music, we
            met an additional time between our two Tuesday audio team meetings
            for this Pre-Alpha I sprint. We wanted to collaborate on identifying
            the beginnings of Project Tower’s musical identity. Since the game’s
            theme that of Old Norse mythology, we researched and discussed which
            instruments, musical modes, and styles to use in order to reinforce
            the game’s theming. As the tone of the project was recently refined
            by the team working on the game’s narrative, we were also able to
            discuss how to refine our own musical devices and tone. We created a
            page in Confluence to record our ideas to refer to later on. This
            also serves as a living document as we find more resources and come
            up with more focused ideas.
            <br><br>
            Additionally, we started a Youtube
            playlist full of relevant reference music, video game soundtracks,
            traditional Scandinavian music, and otherwise, to find inspiration
            for our own music.
          </p>
          <h4 class="w3-text-white">Composing the Main Menu Theme</h4>
          <p class="small-p-text">Composing the first draft for the main menu
            music began with several challenges and inconveniences, but turned
            out well in the end! The process began with me experimenting with
            various audio tools and plug-ins to see what kind of interesting
            sounds I’d be able to use for the project. I wasn’t yet familiar
            with these newer tools, so I then switched to using tools I was more
            familiar with and ended up with a product that I was satisfied with.
            <br><br>
            I referred to the rough notes on the musical devices to use and tone
            to go for, listened to Emily’s draft of the game’s first level
            theme, and listened to various reference music (mostly examples of
            Scandanavian folk and medieval music). These greatly helped inform
            the direction of my own work and made sure that my menu theme would
            coincide thematically with the level music as well as with the rest
            of the game.

          </figure>
          <p class="small-p-text">With the notes and music references, I sought out instruments that
            resemble those used in old Scandinavia while using low strings as a
            drone that ground the piece. I found the instruments I wanted but
            wanted to make these synthesized instruments sound more convincing
            and expressive. However, the particular device I needed for this
            wasn’t working as expected, so I ended up spending a long time
            troubleshooting without being able to resolve all of the issues. I
            ultimately had to abandon the device for now and do the best I could
            with more traditional and limiting methods for the time being.

          </figure>
          <p class="small-p-text">In the end, I think the main menu music draft I’ve produced sounds
            like a solid start with a melancholic tone, traditional-sounding
            instruments, and sound samples of the sea all to reinforce the
            game’s tone and help create a musical identity within the game’s
            soundtrack.
